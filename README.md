# ByteWaves - Acoustic Data Modem

ByteWaves is a Python-based acoustic modem that encodes and decodes data into sound waves using a multi-frequency shift keying (MFSK) technique. It leverages Reed-Solomon error correction to ensure data integrity even in noisy environments. This project provides a simple yet effective way to transmit data between devices using only a speaker and a microphone.

## Features

- **Multi-Frequency Shift Keying (MFSK)**: Robust modulation scheme using 8 distinct frequencies
- **Reed-Solomon Error Correction**: Advanced error correction with configurable ECC bytes
- **Adaptive Equalization**: Real-time channel compensation for audio distortion
- **CRC Validation**: Cyclic redundancy checks for data integrity verification
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test suite with unit, integration, and performance tests
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Installation

You can install ByteWaves directly from PyPI using pip:

```sh
pip install bytewaves
```

### Development Installation

For development and testing, install with development dependencies:

```sh
# Using uv (recommended)
uv sync --dev

# Or using pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the modem from your terminal:

```sh
bytewaves
```

This will launch the interactive command-line interface, where you can choose to send or receive data.

### Testing

The project includes a comprehensive testing framework:

```sh
# Run all tests
./scripts/test.sh

# Run specific test categories
make test-unit        # Unit tests only
make test-integration # Integration tests only
make test-performance # Performance tests only

# Run with coverage report
make test-all
```

- **âœ… CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing with GitHub Actions across multiple Python versions

### Documentation

Clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial for making the project accessible and maintainable.

- **Protocol Specification**: Write a detailed document specifying the communication protocol, including packet structure, modulation scheme, and error correction methods.
- **API Reference**: Generate a complete API reference for the codebase to assist developers in extending the project.
- **User Guide**: Create a user-friendly guide with examples and tutorials on how to use the modem for sending and receiving data.

### User Interface (UI)

Improving the user interface will make the modem more intuitive and easier to use.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Develop a GUI that provides real-time feedback, including:
  - A frequency spectrum visualizer.
  - A constellation diagram to monitor signal quality.
  - Progress indicators for data transmission.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Enhancements**: Improve the existing CLI with more informative output and better command parsing.

### Packaging and Installation

To simplify distribution and installation, the project will be packaged for standard repositories.

- **PyPI Distribution**: Package the project for distribution on the Python Package Index (PyPI), allowing for easy installation via `pip`.
- **Dependency Management**: Streamline dependency management to ensure a smooth installation process across different platforms.
